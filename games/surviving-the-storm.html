        <p>On 23/6/2024 I made the code for this game public, I wrote it a while ago and didn't realize how poorley
            somethings are written. This is just a simple 2D sandbox game where you can build small structures to
            avoid a storm that will kill you.
        </p>
        <p>Requirements and build instructions are listed in the 
            <a href="https://https://github.com/NathanMcMillan54/the-storm?tab=readme-ov-file#build-and-install">README</a>
            . It's only supported on Linux, it might work on MacOS.
