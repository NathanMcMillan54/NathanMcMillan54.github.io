	<p>A bit about me:</p>

	<p>My name is Nathan McMillan I've been programming since I was 7, my first projects were simple HTML/Js games. I
		still work on games in Python every once in a while. You can see and install some of them
		<a href="games/list.html">here</a>. For the past year (2021) I've been getting into OS development which is
		starting to become one of my favorite topics in programming, I've been writing a kernel in Rust called
		<a href="https://github.com/NathanMcMillan54/novusk">Novusk</a>, it is inspired by Linux and I hope one day
		it becomes something anyone can use.</p>
