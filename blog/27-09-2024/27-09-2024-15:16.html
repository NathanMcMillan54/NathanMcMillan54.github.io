<p>After sometime of rewriting and implementing things that were not already in DLW it is now somewhat usable. I have noticed that external distributor communication is incredibly slow (about a 20 - 30 second delay) and local distributor communication is about 5 seconds. At the moment I'm not looking very far into this because its speed isn't a huge concern (in my opinion), but I think the main reason for it being slow is the amount of time spent reading incase something comes up in the last millisecond.</p>
<p>Now I'm going to go over the services for DarkLight that I've written in it's private repository a long time ago and see if anything needs to be changed. Once they're properly added to the public repository I think DLW can have a proper initail release. After that all that will need to be done is writing an instance manager and then fixing the very long list of problems in this project.</p>
